# D++ Copy Bot using D++ library

main is in MyBot/MyBot.cpp.

This repo includes the D++ library so you don't have to clone D++.

You can update the D++ library using -> git pull upstream main.

I recommend naming the bot the same as your discord handle and using the same profile picture.

Add your token, source channel, and target channels for the bot to run properly.
